##  Objectives
- To build a basic Android app as part of my Internshala Training on Android Development.
- The app lists some books, and allows the user to check their details and favourite them. It consists of a dashboard where the books are listed with all their details.
- The list can be sorted according to rating & price.
- We can favourite the books we want, which are displayed in the `Favourite Books` section.
- The database of books comes packaged with the app, and is stored on the user's phone itself.
